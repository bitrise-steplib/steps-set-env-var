  Set Environment Variable
summary: |
  Set a value for one or more Environment Variables.
description: |-
  With this Step, you can set the same value for as many Environment Variables (Env Vars) as you like. Subsequent Steps in your Workflow can use these Env Vars.

  You can create new Env Vars with this Step and you can also update existing Env Vars with a new value.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. In the **Value for copy into Environment Variables** input, set the value that you want for your Env Vars.
  1. In the **Destination Environment Variables** input, add the keys for the Env Vars that you want to set.

     For example, MY_ENV_VAR. You can add multiple Env Var keys by separating them with a space. Do not add the $ sign in front of the key!
